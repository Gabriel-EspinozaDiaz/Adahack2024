# Adahack2024
## Inspiration
The inspiration came from our backgrounds in biology and neuroscience. We wanted to translate not just our love of biology, but our love of the scientific process - so instead of teaching about known facts, we wanted to teach kids about experimental methods used in modern biology/neuroscience.
## What it does
We have some minigames around transcriptomics and basic mouse memory experiments, along with a home page. We're working on a cell culture game as well!
## How we built it
We used React and Javascript/Javascript library (Phaser)
## Challenges we ran into
Most of us come from a biology background, so this was a mostly novel experience. A lot of our background is in bioinformatics if anything, and two of us have never even touched Javascript before. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We came up with a fun idea and even though we haven't yet executed them the way we want to, it's a pretty good start!
## What we learned
That StackOverflow solves almost everything, and having a walk solves everything else.
## What's next for Biology Minigames
We'd like to finish the cell culture minigame, as well as expand on the minigames we started. The mouse minigame maze will be changed and instead of time, there will also be tracking of path length rather than just time, for example.
